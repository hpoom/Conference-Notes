Health and Safety notice, contains JSON

Books -> Chapters -> Pages

What is the user need? - Motto of GDS (Government Digital Services)

Children only care about _Events_ and _Characters_ not Chapters and Pages.

JSON API & HAL - Whooo this is what I came for!

HAL embeds child documents recursively.
JSON API does more for nesting.

As an adult we care about the _Context_ of the book. We have different user needs to a child.

DBpedia is a linked data API version of Wikipedia.
DBpedia uses schema.org

JSON-LD (JSON for Linking Data) - W3C recommended format.
GMail uses JSON-LD for things like Github pull requests.

Is a Ruby engineer, which has effected some of her API mistakes in the past.
