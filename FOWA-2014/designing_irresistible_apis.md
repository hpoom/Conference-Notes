# Designing Irresistible APIs

## Kirsten Hunter - @synedra - 30 Sept 2014 15:25

How to design APIs that don't make developers cry.

Worked at Netflix and LinkedIn, as well as 3scale.

API First - Single API back end, powering everything from App to Web etc
API First can be done by big established companies. Etsy was example used.

Netflix moved from being an advantage to have Netflix on a piece of hardware, to being required to have Netflix on a piece of hardware. Netflix changed the game and did that with APIs.

Focus on core competences. Don't build in telephony, just use Twilio.

Make your website use your API, it will force your API to be feature rich.

Bundle your stuff so that people can make a single call. If you don't build what your users want, they will do elsewhere.

More about usability and less about scaleability. If it is not useable you won't have any users and won't need to scale your API.

_Hypermedia_ - Should be used to allow discovery and exploring.

Copy others APIs. If somebody already has an API out there that looks like the sort of thing you want to achieve, copy it.

Devs are not the same as normal people, they don't need marketing to make them use an API. They need a getting started guide.

REST take the bits that work for you.

Versioning. Kirsten agrees with myself that version should not be in the URL and instead be in the header or query string.
