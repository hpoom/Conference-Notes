Works for Telefonica (O2) in their Labs dept.

History was us using Winamp to play MP3s, 11 years ago.
Winamp had visualisations. Lead to a thought that maybe this could be done in the browser.

WebGL for visuals and Web Audio API.

Demo of visuals working off audio in the browser, then listening to mic

`navigator.vibrate([30,200])`

Speech API

Gamepad API
