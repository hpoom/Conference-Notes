### Fastlane

> How would you like 2 hours back every week?

Going to talk about how Fastlane can aid this for Mobile App Developers

Twitter know about building apps, they don't just build the twitter app but also build Periscope and Vine.

Fastlane is a set of command line tools to automate and aid your development.
Fastlane is now part of the Fabric suite.

Fastlane looks like Grunt/Gulp for mobile development. It is more config driven with a YAML file that defines the actions you want. Think NPM script or Travis config file. It is tooling, nice tooling but more a port of ideas from the JS world to Native App Development world.

*I feel that if you build for the web then all this tooling already exists. Maybe not for Native Mobile Development, but is that not an even stronger argument for Cordova and similar Web to Mobile App frameworks?*

The key message even if this tech does not apply to me, is that you should invest in tooling instead of doing repetitive tasks. If you don't invest in tooling your not doing development right!
