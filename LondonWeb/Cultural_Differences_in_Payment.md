**Germany** 46% ELV, and only 9% Credit Cards

PesaPal they have in Uganda, Botswana, and other African countries. Came out of the population using mobile phone credit as a money system.

300million M-Pesa accounts in the world. Also used outside of Africa, used in Romania and thats in Europe. More mobile phones that toilets in Africa.

Data tells us that in 4-8 years the continent of Africa will move over to widely accessed internet and have smart phones widely adopted.

Research recently found that processing cash transactions is significantly more expensive than processing credit cards. Cash is very expensive to process for purchases (even taking into account card processing fees).

ATM machines are on the decline and are very expensive to operate. 

Qiwi is a Russian startup, that tries to make ATMs more affordable. The machines they operate allow you to deposit and withdraw cash.

One of the biggest examples of digital currency is Oyster.
