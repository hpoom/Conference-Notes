### What is Docker? ###

Docker is not a Virtual Machine

When you top in Docker you only see top and bash.
The process ideas you see are container level process ids. They are mapped back to higher level process ids at the host level.

Does not have the usual overheads of provisioning a virtual machine.

- Cheap Vm
- DevOps Enabler
- Microservices enabler

Life before Docker was Vagrant, Jenkins, Chef. Now Docker ticks all those boxes.

Another good application is legacy applications. They can put them into a container and get it work.

There is other containerisation solutions out there, for example CoreOS.
