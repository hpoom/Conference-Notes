[Kong](http://getkong.org/) is an open source proxy for API Management

Kong is built on Nginx and Cassandra. The management of Kong is via a restful interface.

_So... how to design a good API?_

There are many benefits to speccing out an API before you build it.

Where is the dreamweaver for APIs?

There are many tools out there, but which is the right tool?

- [API Designer](https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/api/api-designer) from Mulesoft
- APIARY - API Blueprint
- Swagger
- _Shamless plug_ - Mashape Docs
- Restlet Studio
- [Mocaroni](https://www.mocaroni.com/)
- Readme.io
- Gelato.io - _Today it is Alpha (very early days)_
- APImatic

Healthy API design comes from iterating.
