# Candies for everybody: hacking from 9 to 6

## Alberto LÃ³pez - @albertuslm - 6 May 2015

Developer evangelist at Braintree, now a Paypal company.

Going to be talking about hackathons for open source and internet of things.

78% of all companies run on open source!

They have card.io which is a great tool

[Spark Core](https://www.spark.io/) is cool, it is a Pi for connected things. Enables devices to become part of the internet of things. It has good open APIs.

Demo of a candy vending machine powered by braintree for payments and twitter for ordering candy.

IoT (Internet of Things) is not a flash in the pan.
