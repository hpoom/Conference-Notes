# Building Typeform.io 

## Victor Bjelkholm - @victorbjelkholm - 7 May 2015

People in natural language ask a question then wait for an answer.

Typeform is trying to take this approach with forms. 

Victor is a Developer Evangelist at Typeform.

Typeform uses a JSON description to build forms.

They are focused on making the process a simple as possible for developers.

The advantage of a staged form is that you can skip questions. "Do you own a house?", if answer is "no" you would not ask them what type of house.

Working with legacy systems is **hard**.

They use Slack as a community and invite their customers into Slack to talk to them about what they want from the product.

Choose your battles carefully.

They use [LotusRB](http://lotusrb.org/), sounds like a services framework for Ruby.
