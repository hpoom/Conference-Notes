# Your API Deserves More Respect: Make It a Product 

## Andrew Seward - @MrAndrew - 7 May 2015

Going to cover why it is important to consider your API as a product.

Works for [Esendex](http://www.esendex.co.uk/) - Mission critical SMS.

Your API is a Product!

Your users don't want an API, they have a problem and want Product that solves their problem.

How do you talk about an API? Talk about what you can do with it and why. Don't talk about how it technically works.

Examples in slides of how to, and how not to do, API sales pitches.
