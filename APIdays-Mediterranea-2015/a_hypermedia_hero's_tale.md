# A Hypermedia Hero's Tale

## Mike Amundsen - @mamund - 6 May 2015

A story of a village that has a problem that needs solving.

You leave the village to go find a magical city.

You get handed two things for your quest. A box and some maps.

The maps are not maps they are step by step instructions and are really hard to follow.

They are not only instructions (not maps), but they are also out of date.

James J. Gibson - The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception (1986).
In this book he coined the term "affordance".

Next morning you look at the maps again. Even though they are worthless they are all you have.

You stubble across a master tool maker. She has lots of tools and you like her tools. You sit and talk by the fire with a stew. The toolmaker talks about how the tools give her a rich set of affordances.

You go behind the tool shed and find a long wall that goes as far as the eye can see. In it is a door with P on it. You pull and pull and pull. Nothing happens, you then push and the door opens.

Donald A. Normal - The Design of Everyday Things (1988,2013). In it he talks about Seven Stages of Action - "Action Lifecycle".

You walk through the door into the forrest. You stubble across another character. You ask what he is doing. He says he is turning data into information. He passes you a piece of paper, but it is all code. Then in the code you see a message.

Roy T. Fielding - Architectural Styles and Design of Network-Based Software Architectures

You get to the city. People great you. You get taken to a room where people are typing at terminals. 

Alfred H. S. Korzybski - Science and Sanity (1933). In the book coined the phrase "The Map is not the territory".

You start to leave. You go back through the forrest. On the way back it appears a lot easier, and the forrest appears smaller. 

When you get back to the village and you tell your tale, people don't believe you. It is hard to teach others, unless they have experienced what you have.
