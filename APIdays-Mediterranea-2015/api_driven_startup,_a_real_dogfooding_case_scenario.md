Talking about building a product with a strong API drive.

Building product today you need to integrate with many things. It can be overwhelming.

Monolithic App - Does not work anymore, Microservices are a better option.

Every language has good REST frameworks. Does not matter which language you use there are frameworks out there to support you.

_Quick live demo of building a REST API quickly using [Sails JS](http://sailsjs.org/)_

- Always build REST
- Always use HTTPS
- Always offer caching (good cache headers)
- Consider Hypermedia

Don't run your own servers. PaaS, Javi recommends Heroku.

Mention of bower for managing front-end dependencies.

Always build your front-end as dumb client. Always put your business logic in the backend.

Speaker advocating Ionic for building mobile apps. Probably because the Angular preference.
