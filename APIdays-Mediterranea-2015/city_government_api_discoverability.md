# City Government API Discoverability

## Mark Boyd - @mgboydcom - 7 May 2015

Edmunds is an online publication about cars, they have seen the power of APIs and opened up a lot over APIs.

Although calls to API were strong, downloads of SDK were not that high.

Edmunds off links to certified developers. If you a business without tech talent then you can find a developer through the developer portal.

Philips Hue has had steady growth in API use. What you see with Philips is developer evangelism does rely drive use of the API.

As well as a page of official SKDs they also index SDKs and libraries written by other developers that interact with Philips Hue.

SimilarWeb used for search word tracking. Used by Moz. Very strong groth, like the others, in 2014. They have tools that link their APIs into spreadsheets.

TransportAPI is transport data aggregator for London. Consume many existing transport APIs and then aggregate behind a single API for people to consume.

They got growth after demoing their API in products, TubeRadar being the main one. These apps that consumed their API were featured in top UK news sites (Guardian & BBC)

_Insert slide on what makes a good API Developer Portal_

Mention of Contentful. They use search well, and rank high on the key words they associate with.
