# Devs & Testers, BFFs with Virtual APIs

Paul see's APIs like environmental concepts.
Reuse, Reduce, Recycle

But APIs come with a lot of baggage. The APIs need to be well documented.
Swagger is a good tool for this.

When you have a developer with no internet (on a plane, in a country with flaky internet), you need to offer them tools to aid their development.

REST is like a zelda dungeon without a map and a compass. 

Good multitask people are hard to find. There should be a separation of concern between the person producing an API and those outside testing that API.

It is important to have separation when it comes to testing. "Don't test the code you write, get somebody else to do it."
