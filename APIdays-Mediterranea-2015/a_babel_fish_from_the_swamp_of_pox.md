# A Babel fish from the swamp of POX

## Ross Garrett - @gssor - 6 May 2015

The Swamp of POX is the beginning for APIs

Berners-Lee - Even if a client and server have never met one another before, they can still interact. They don't need to be familiar with one another to be able to talk.

Also it should be easy to "browse". To look around and discover.

What is HTTP? There is a key word in the answer. Many APIs are doing it wrong, they overlook hypertext.

The web is more that just HTTP. It is HTTP, URIs, and HTML. We need all these to have the web.

Demonstrating how using an API looks as a webpage. When displayed this way APIs that don't have hypermedia appear like madness!
