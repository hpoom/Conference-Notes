### Going to cover

- Version Control
- Deploying
- Automation

#### Version Control

Use Git Flow to manage release and deployment branches  
Git Flow works well in SourceTree  

#### Deploying

Talked about Interflora as a good example of scaling requirements  
Mothers Day, Valentines Day, etc

AWS is the main player in cloud

Beanstalk <-> OpsWorks <-> CloudFormation <-> Roll Your Own  
Convenient <---> Control

Demo of the EB command line tools

*Mention of [CloudBees](http://www.cloudbees.com)*

#### Automation

Jenkins CI

[Deploy IO](http://dploy.io) - Simple deploy from git to something simple. Instead of FTP. Less than CI for when CI is overkill.

Docker

*Devops* is becoming trendy. Thats OK though, we should all be doing devops.
