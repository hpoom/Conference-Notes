Talked about cross browser/device testing.

##### browser-sync

Mention of the Pyhton one liner web server :D

##### Ghost for browser syncing

##### Alfred

Has a script that resets her dev environment. She has then linked that into Alfred so it is simple to run.

##### Dash

[Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) is documenation manuals offline. Simple and quick to lookup.

Build your own Alfred workflows. Automate all the things!!!  
Lots of community workflows for Alfred

##### Grunt

*See slides for notes on this section*

Kitt says it's OK to have 10 plugins that do the same thing. One will eventually rise to the top.  
*slide 116*

##### Modern.ie

There are Alfred community workflows for Modern.ie

##### Javascript

JSHint all your JS  
Unit test all your JS  
*Might have been nice to see a mention of JSCS*

##### Images

Images are the first target when looking to shrik your website in order to speed up your sites

*grunt-respoonsive-images* plugin deals will all the image sizes for you

*Great to see [Can I Use](http://caniuse.com) mentioned!*

*grunt-montage* for image spiriting

##### ZSH (for the win)

Use alias
[alias.sh](http://alias.sh) - A paste bin for people sharing alias

### PART 2

##### CSS Pre Processors

Sass, LESS, and Stylus

Sourcemaps - Get sass files in devtools for debugging instead of the resulting css. It is only for *dev environment*, do not do in *production*!
