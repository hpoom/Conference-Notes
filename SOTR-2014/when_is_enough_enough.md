# "When is enough enough?"

### Dealing with browser versions

Go where the money is. If people are paying money and they are on old browsers you need to support them.

Analytics does not always help. If you don't support X browser or X version then people with those requirements will not visit so will not show in your analytics.

IE9 would be an ideal baseline if you have a choice.

### Dealing with the user experience

Users ask for more features.
If you ask users, some report bugs, but lots ask for more features.

Most users don't use all the features. The more features you add, the more confusion you add.

### When is enough Automation is enough

Was compared to code coverage. People are not doing automation or code coverage enough. Until people are doing it too much it is not enough.

Talk around the XKCD where sometimes automation out weighs the time it saves.

Also there is an obsession with automation and micro tooling in the industry right now.
