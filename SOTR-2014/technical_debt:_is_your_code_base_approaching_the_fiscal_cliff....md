- What is Technical Debt?
- Debt Accumulation

> A little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly


Building new client site involved copy and paste

Continuous Delivery  
They now use Jenkins

Went from 8m lines of code to 800k lines  
Built a framework  

Mentioned using *Redgate* tools to manage diffs in database

Cloud based logging using Logstash and Kibana  
Don't host these tools yourself, take SaaS where possible

It is always worth paying off Tech Debt
