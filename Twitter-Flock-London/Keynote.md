First developer event outside of US.
The next generation of app can come from anywhere. 
Twitter feel the time spent on phones is more an app experience than mobile browsing experience

**(note to self must tweet about my views on apps. Desktop Vs Mobile)**

Why does twitter care about building dev tools for mobile?

- Stability (Crashlytics)
- Revenue (mopub)
- Identity (Digits)
- Distribution (Beta Crashlytics, Answers)

Onto stage Bear Douglas.
Going to tell us what *Fabric* is.

Twitter were facing the same challenges as other app developers. Hearing same issues again and again. Fabric was to solve these challenges.

Apps crash. Thats a fact. Stability matters. Users tolerance for crashes is low!
**Crashlytics** is the solution. Sentry/Bugsnag for mobile apps.

Crashlytics is tracking 5.5billion crashes every month.

Crashlytics also has a beta tool for launching beta builds to a closed user groups for testing.

**Answers** is an app event tracking tool. Looks a bit like MixPanel. Answers is realtime, live data. Supports alerting too (I assume like pagerduty).

**mopub** for monetising app. Looks to be an ad platform for mobile. Serving 170billion ads per month. It's a flexible ad platform, so allows lots of different ad strategies. From inline tweets to banner ads.

**Digits** Chatting to mobile partners up to 50% of sign up was not with single sign on from common social login tools. People were choosing email and password to sign up to avoid connecting to social. But what about people without email?

Digits is white label sign up/sign on solution for phone numbers. Twitter already has a large SMS infrastructure so this product made sense.

There is no login and password, just a phone number for both identity and security (username and password). There is an auth SMS at the start to confirm who you are.
