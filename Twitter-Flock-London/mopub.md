# MoPub: Make Money With Your Apps

## John Egan - @jegania - 19 Feb 2015


Talk about advertising. It will cover banner ads.

Banner ads can be brilliant. But advertising is not a "one size fits all" strategy.

Looks like the mopub ad server is quite intelligent. Knows things like state of internet connection (wifi, mobile etc). As well as knowing which app the user is in when requesting an ad. The call to get an ad is about a lot more than just who is bidding the highest.

Bidders can bid on key attributes of users. So they can target specific audiences.

The speaker is selling the dream that an ad back app can mean you get well funded for your free app/game. It can allow you to quit your day job and take a good income. (Flow Free was the app example)
