# TwitterKit: Tap Into the Pulse of the Planet

## Andy Piper - @andypiper - 19 Feb 2015


Talk about integrating twitter into apps. Talk about the twitter API, or the SKD that consumes the API.

OAuth is difficult.
API Key Management can be tricky.
Mention of API payloads being hard to digest.

TwitterKit is an SDK to wrapper the Twitter API. This solves the problems detailed above.
(my view, fix your API. SDK's are cool, but not not be mandatory because your API is hard to consume)

`Fabric.with(...)`

Lots of talk of covering both iOS (ObjectiveC and Swift) and Android (Java). What about Javascript? - [tweeted this](https://twitter.com/hpoom/status/568436504638259200)

This talk is a product showcase of both Fabric and what TwitterKit SDK can do to make it easier for developers to use Fabric in their apps.

TwitterKit is used in the Github codebases mentioned earlier. Go an check those out.
