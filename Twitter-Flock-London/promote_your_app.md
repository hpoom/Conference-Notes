# Using Twitter to Promote Your App and Get Growth

## Bryan Sise - @bryansise - 19 Feb 2015


One way twitter tried to get app growth was to get OEMs to pre install the twitter app on devices.

Second way was to make the app easier to find and get from the app store/play store.

Third way twitter used was to get existing users to onboard new users.

The average smart phone users has 65 apps installed on their device, but only regularly use 10 apps on average.

288million active twitter users. 80% of which use mobile as primary device for accessing twitter.

Three simple steps for twitter integration:

#### Cards

Cards add context to the tweak. Store links, photos, music etc.
Cards look easy to implement.

You can use twitter cards to provide an app install button on a tweet.
This drives user growth for your app.

Add deeplink schemes to your app!
Deeplink schemes are used by twitter cards.

#### Sharing

Sharing best practices. Tweets with great contact get the most engagement. Not just about tweeting links, also about the summary you put on the tweet.

#### Analytics

Measure App Conversion. Answers.

Answers give you event tracking data from twitter cards.

Cross data of both tweets and app analysis. So can see which app downloads were because of a tweet. Allows you to see which were the most successful tweets/cards at achieving your goals.

### Twitter Ads

Covering how to target ads to get your target audience. Tailored Audiences. You can upload a list of twitter id's and you can include or exclude them from ad campaigns. So you could exclude people who already have your app from seeing an ad to download your app and only show those ads to people who don't yet have the app.

Twitters talk about organic and paid for acquisition/engagement reminds me of Googles approach.
Which is interesting because I do use twitter more than search engines to discover new content.
