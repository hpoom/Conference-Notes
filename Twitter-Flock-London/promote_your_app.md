# Using Twitter to Promote Your App and Get Growth

## Bryan Sise - @bryansise - 19 Feb 2015


One way twitter tried to get app growth was to get OEMs to pre install the twitter app on devices.

Second way was to make the app easier to find and get from the app store/play store.

Third way twitter used was to get existing users to onboard new users.

The average smart phone users has 65 apps installed on their device, but only regularly use 10 apps on average.

288million active twitter users. 80% of which use mobile as primary device for accessing twitter.

Three simple steps for twitter integration:

### Cards

Cards add context to the tweak. Store links, photos, music etc.
Cards look easy to implement.

You can use twitter cards to provide an app install button on a tweet.
This drives user growth for your app.

Add deeplink schemes to your app!
Deeplink schemes are used by twitter cards.

### Sharing
