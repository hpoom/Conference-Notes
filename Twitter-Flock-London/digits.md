Users forget their passwords all the time. Users want to use the product but they are locked out by a forgotten password.

Twiiter's solution, Digits.

In emerging markets, trips to countries with entry level smartphones, things are different. Mobile data costs are crazy high, and phones although smart are not $500+ phones.

In some markets, the smartphone users have never had a PC/Laptop etc. Their first computer and online experience is though a smartphone. The primary identity on a smart phone is the phone number, the phone number is the user handle.

Twitter still things social login is excellent. They are not replacing social login, just complementing it and offering choice.

Getting the operator from a phone number is available from other providers, but it is costly. Sending an SMS and tracking that in an app can be achieved but is not easy. Twitter makes this easy with Digits.
